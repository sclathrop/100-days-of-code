# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 3, 2018
### The focus

**Today's Progress**: Removing the domain from the list of my Domains for Sale (https://stuartlathrop.com/domains). Rebuilding my Dev Environment.

**Thoughts**: The hardest part was deciding where to start. I had several possible projects to chose from, but to make this successful I had to pick one. I chose to finally develop the domain: http:\\www.freepasslist.com

**Link to work:** Nothing yet...

### Day 2: May 4, 2018
### Definine the target
**Today's Progress**: Success only measures against a goal. Today's hour was spent on addressing some of my original questions around the same. Feedback welcomed...

### Day 2 (EOD): May 4, 2018
**Today's Progress**: One step forward, two back...

**Thoughts**: There's an old drawing about success (http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/studentsuccess/2014/01/09/success-linear/) which I have always thought appropos. Today was one of those jagged trail days: the work I did this morning resulted in the accidental crash of my own website; tonight, and likely a little more time in the morning, was devoted to putting it back online. A delay on day 2, how unusual... Well, I had intended to go back to building my site this way&hellip;
