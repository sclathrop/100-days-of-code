# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 3, 2018
### The focus

**Today's Progress**: Removing the domain from the list of my Domains for Sale (https://stuartlathrop.com/domains). Rebuilding my Dev Environment.

**Thoughts**: The hardest part was deciding where to start. I had several possible projects to chose from, but to make this successful I had to pick one. I chose to finally develop the domain: http:\\www.freepasslist.com

**Link to work:** Nothing yet...
